// 3. pre-run appended it, var Module = {}; ..generated code..

// case, where this code here is minified but Module was defined
// elsewhere (e.g. case 4 above). We also need to check if Module

// before the code. Then that object will be used in the code, and you

   * or change in sign.
   *
   * In the algorithms below, we frequently reduce the negative case to the
   * positive case by negating the input(s) and then post-processing the result.
   * Note that we must ALWAYS check specially whether those values are MIN_VALUE
   * (-2^63) because -MIN_VALUE == MIN_VALUE (since 2^63 cannot be represented as
   * a positive number, it overflows back into a negative).  Not handling this
   * case would often result in infinite recursion.
